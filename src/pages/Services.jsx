              All packages include a 90-minute intake session. This session
              could be compared to an initial visit to your doctor or therapist.
              Through an intake form, you will share your history. We then
              review the form together to determine what your best life looks
              like to you. We will discuss goals and any blockages or barriers
              that arise that are preventing you from enjoying your best life.
              Once we do that, together we will develop an action plan. Over the
              next several weeks or months that we work together, I will be
              guiding you to discover, clarify and align to help you reach your
              goals and your best life. steps are part of the fundamental
              process, but only you can determine how much time, energy and
              resources you have to work on achieving the results you desire.

            <p>
              Emotional clearing method session (ECM) combines emotional healing
              techniques and mind body medicine with the stimulation of neural
              pathways to release negative psychological patterns, attachments
              to negative emotions and limiting beliefs on the conscious and
              unconscious levels. EMC is not a discussion; it is an experience.
              With EMC youâ€™ll experience deep relaxation, awareness, acceptance
              and witnessing.
